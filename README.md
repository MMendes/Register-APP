Register-APP
============
It finally lives! :)

This is a first attempt at a simple App.

It is a simple register App I am developing that could be used in my former company to register their daily
routes and deposits.

Although I intend to expand on its fucntions once I have the knowledge to do so, but this is a single-line copy of the register I used to use at my previous job. 

When at the company I developed this table in excel, but thought it would be much cooler to try and do it in HTML, CSS and JS.

Here is a link to the app so far.

Following up-dates should enable multiple sums in a sigle input field and still display the total value of that input field, along with storing the data in a database for later conference.
